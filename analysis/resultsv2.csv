This worked pretty well when the path was short but was less reliable for longer ones.

For counting the number of neighbors with a given degree, I hovered over the target node then swept my eyes in a circle around each neighbor. If it was ambiguous (e.g. because of overlapping edges) I would double check by hovering on the neighbor.","There were two main challenges. On every visualization style, edges sometimes overlapped visually which made it necessary to rely on the hover tool to figure out what was going on. And specifically on the last style, the fisheye effect made it difficult to have both highlighted nodes clearly in view, which made finding a shortest path more difficult.","The last style was visually fun, but less intuitive than the globe and the plane. I guess the main advantage would be automatically magnifying the focused node, but I feel like the effect was too strong here, making it hard to look at the whole graph all at once."

I found myself hovering consistently even when the number of degrees was a low number like 1 or 2","i strongly disliked that zooming into the visualizations would make the lines thicker. i would zoom in because two graph lines were very close together and it was hard to see if hovering made both lines thicker or only one line thicker. and so i wanted to zoom in to increase the distance between the two lines, not to make them thicker. another thing that bothered me is that hovering over a node would not change neighboring highlighted nodes, and this was bad because sometimes there were three nodes in a straight line with the middle node being highlighted and one of the two nodes on the edge being highlighted and so when you hovered over the highlighted node on the edge, the line going from that node to the third non-highlighted node in the three-node-straight-line would be on-top-of the line between the two highlighted nodes and would hide it, meaning that hovering didn't help decide whether that middle highlighted node was actually connected to the other two nodes or was just on top",the visualization did not fit on my laptop screen unless i zoomed out the browser page. i did not zoom out during the survey and i had no trouble

For the most frequent degree questions, I also started with the smallest degree nodes which allowed me to rule out the larger degree ones without having to count depending on the pattern. ","The click-and-drag for elliptic surfaces felt a little off for how it moved the graph at times, when dragging near the edges of the circle. That may just be an artifact of how the surface though, and not an actual issue.","Typo ""Scrool"" for the first break at the hyperbolic surface."
